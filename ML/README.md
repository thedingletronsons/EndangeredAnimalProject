1) don't edit any of the code right now
2) run the custom data bringer on your pycharm not on this link
3) use this link only for my instructions here
4) delete any changes you've made on pycharm unless you've already saved commited and pushed it
5) only add images to the empty folder
6) only use the custom data bringer by adjusting the animal and query.
7) delete images that couldn't be downloaded or have an error
8) delete irrelavent images in the folder.
9) run image size deleter and adjust the animal and directory to delete duplicates
10) after you've cleaned the data and have 100-150 good quality images of the animal, use data augmenter to make augmented images
11) after you've finished and feel like you've done enough, commit and push the files to git-repository! This is the most important step
12) start with hawksbill turtle if you see that it's done move on to the next and so forth
